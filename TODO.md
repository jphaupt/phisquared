Topics/courses that I wish to complete in the future (my preferences might
change on a whim though!)

<h2> Physics </h2> 
<h3> Electrodynamics </h3> 
TODO: stuff goes here 
(want to do standard curriculum + extra stuff done in my undergrad + extra topics in computational electrodynamics and photonic crystals)

<h3> Classical Mechanics </h3>
TODO: stuff goes here 
(use primarily Landau and Lifshitz, but also Taylor and make a kind of in-between in terms of rigour) 

<h3> Quantum Mechanics </h3> 
TODO: stuff goes here 
(use primarily Sakurai)

<h3> Computational Physics </h3> 
TODO: stuff goes here 
(use primarily Thijssen, but emphasise good practice and make at a considerably more basic level)

<h3> Photovoltaics </h3>
TODO: stuff goes here
(use primarily Nelson)
A brief (not-yet-done) tutorial on the Shockley-Quiesser limit can be found <a href = "https://github.com/jphaupt/sq_julia">here</a>.

<h3> Extra Topics </h3>
<h4> Artificial Gauge Fields </h4>
Some notes I wrote up about artificial gauge fields and quantum simulation can be found <a class = "page-link" href = "/agf_notes.pdf/">here</a>. I did this for a graduate class on quantum optics at the University of Toronto. They are just an introduction and take heavily from one review article it references. I just show more steps, and focus on topics for the class.

<h4> Machine Learning in Physics </h4>
TODO: stuff goes here 

<h4> Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics </h4>
TODO stuff goes here

<h2> Mathematics </h2> 

<h2> Computer Science </h2>

Hello, I am still getting things worked out here. Right now this website will just be dedicated to hosting some notes for a class project/seminar I'm working on. Afterwards I hope it'll be something richer.
