title: Introduction to Artificial Gauge Fields
#author: jph
---

Here I'll put some (links to) notes about artifical gauge fields for U of T's PHY 2203, final seminar project. I'm putting it on this website just for fun. 

I'll also need to figure out how to do references (or at least a bibliography) in markdown.

$$
\vec \Omega = \bmat \Omega_R \\ 0 \\ -\delta \emat
$$
