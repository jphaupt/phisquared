title: Resources
---

Here I'm just compiling a list of resources (primarily textbooks) for topics in which I am interested in. It also allows me to empty all the clutter on my Amazon wishlist. Some of these I have studied, some of these I've studied to death, but most of them are books I _want_ to read, at some point. There's a good chance I won't ever get around to all of them, seeing as there's so many. This list typically isn't up to date, as hopefully I would be focusing on reading a book instead of thinking about all the books I want to read. â˜º

Note that this list is primarily targeted to myself. As such, topics I'm only interested in as an "armchair scientist" have less rigorous (and fewer) resources. This list could just as easily be interpreted as a case of "learning in public."
