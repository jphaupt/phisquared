# About page

TODO update this page, remove the blog (at least for now)

This is where I'll be writing some stuff about the website and myself. See [this blog post](../blog/2020-06-30-hello_world) for a brief explanation.

TODO: make title area smaller in y-direction.
TODO: make margins for main text smaller
TODO: make margins for Home, About, Blog etc larger

For now, I am focusing on the content since that's (obviously) what I am more interested in, but the site certainly needs a lot of formatting improvement


I intend to use this site primarily as expository practice (i.e. a place to write tutorials/references) in physics and occasionally maths and computer science. However, I also want to keep a semi-frequently updated blog about my research and physics more generally. One goal I hope to reach is at some regular frequency (say, a month) to summarise research that I have been reading. I will also write about hobbies and projects unrelated to physics I might be working on.

This site was built in a rather hacky fashion, using Jekyll. I used a combination of the [Jekyll tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) and [this tutorial](https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/) I found online.

All views on this website are my own (and are therefore manifestly correct). Nevertheless,
they do not reflect the views of my employer, the scientific community, or necessarily
anyone else for that matter. That said, if you do find a mistake, if you think something
could be explained better, if you have any content suggestions, or you want to say hi,
please do send me an email.
