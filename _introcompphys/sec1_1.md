There are _a lot_ of resources on Python out there. Simply search the web for "introduction to python" or "numpy" or "python for physicists" or the similar. Because of this, I'll keep this section brief so that you may refer to it quickly when just starting. 

Here, as in the remainder of the course, I assume you have Python 3 installed along with packages from Anaconda (in particular, numpy, matplotlib, and scipy).

## My First Program

TODO 

TODO Introduce the basics, hello world

TODO important packages for scientists

## Basic Operations in Python 

TODO

## Linear Algebra in Python 

TODO introduce things you _could_ do, then say just use numpy!

## Plotting in Python 

TODO introduce Matplotlib
