<p>This is where I’ll be writing some stuff about the website and myself. See <a href="blog/2020-06-30-hello_world.md">this blog post</a> for a brief explanation.

TODO: make margins for Home, About, Blog etc larger

<p>For now, I am focusing on the content since that’s (obviously) what I am more interested in, but the site certainly needs a lot of formatting improvement</p>

<p>I am trying to compile a <a class="page-link" href="/book-list/">list of resources</a> (mostly books) for given topics in which I’m interested in and will periodically update the list linked.

I intend to use this site primarily as expository practice (i.e. a place to write tutorials/references) in physics and occasionally maths and computer science. However, I also want to keep a semi-frequently updated blog about my research and physics more generally. One goal I hope to reach is at some regular frequency (say, a month) to summarise research that I have been reading. I will also write about hobbies and projects unrelated to physics I might be working on.</p>

<p>For a glimpse at my professional interests, you can find a list of (text)books I’ve been reading here. Just for fun, you can also find a list of other books I’ve been reading here.</p>

<p>This site was built in a rather hacky fashion, using Jekyll. I used a combination of the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/">Jekyll tutorial</a> and <a href="https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/">this tutorial</a> I found online.</p>

<p>All views on this website are my own (and are therefore manifestly correct). Nevertheless,
they do not reflect the views of my employer, the scientific community, or necessarily
anyone else for that matter. That said, if you do find a mistake, if you think something 
could be explained better, if you have any content suggestions, or you want to say hi, 
please do send me an email.</p>
