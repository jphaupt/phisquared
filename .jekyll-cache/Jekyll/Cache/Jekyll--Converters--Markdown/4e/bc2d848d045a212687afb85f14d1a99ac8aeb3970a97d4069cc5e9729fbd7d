I"C<p>Here I‚Äôm just compiling a list of resources (primarily textbooks) for topics in which I am interested in. It also allows me to empty all the clutter on my Amazon wishlist. Some of these I have studied, some of these I‚Äôve studied to death, but most of them are books I <em>want</em> to read, at some point. There‚Äôs a good chance I won‚Äôt ever get around to all of them, seeing as there‚Äôs so many. This list typically isn‚Äôt up to date, as hopefully I would be focusing on reading a book instead of thinking about all the books I want to read. ‚ò∫</p>

<p>Note that this list is primarily targeted to myself. As such, topics I‚Äôm only interested in as an ‚Äúarmchair scientist‚Äù have less rigorous (and fewer) resources. This list could just as easily be interpreted as a case of ‚Äúlearning in public.‚Äù</p>
